# Implement the features

## Create a new icon

Reference: https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/icons/

I use GIMP created a png file as the new icon for this app. The file name is `xmind-extractor.png`.

To create the icon, run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm run tauri icon src-tauri/xmind-extractor.png
```

This command will generate icon files for all platforms in the `src-tauri/icons` directory.
